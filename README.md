Initial deliverable is the Task List

Task List Due by March 15

Initial target for Edge Architecture Review Offering is Telco Vertical, emphasis on Observability

Technical Demo needs to emphasize ACM and demonstrate Thanos/Grafana and Visual Web Terminal

Limitations that need to be addressed if we are to use RHPDS:
Observability feature requires access to cloud storage:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.1/html/observing_environments/observing-environments#enabling-observability

The instructions only exist for Amazon S3, GCS, or Azure storage account - none of those things seem to be obtainable through RHPDS.
